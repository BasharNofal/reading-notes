## JS: Expressions + Operators and Functions



There are many types of operators:

1-To assign variable we use `=`, for example: 

  `var x=1 ;`.

2-Arithmatic operators: (`+,-,*,/`) and they can be used as follows:
  
  `x=5+5 ;`.

3-String operators: they are the same as arithmatic operators but they are used for adding for example two strings together:

   `x="H" + "i" = Hi ;`

4-Comparsion Operators: (`<,>,=,<=,=>`) : from their name they are used for comparing two inputs:

    `x=5\<1 ;`

5-Logical Operators: ()
