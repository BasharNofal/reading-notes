# JS: Expressions + Operators and Functions


## Expressions + Operators

There are many types of operators:

1-To assign variable we use `=`, for example: 

  `var x=1 ;`.

2-Arithmatic operators: (`+,-,*,/,++,--`) and they can be used as follows:

```
  x=5+5 ;
  ++x=11;
  --x=9;
```

3-String operators: they are the same as arithmatic operators but they are used for adding for example two strings together:

   `x="H" + "i" = Hi ;`

4-Comparsion Operators: (`<,>,=,<=,=>,!=`) : from their name they are used for comparing two inputs:

   `x=5\<1 ;`

5-Logical Operators: (`&&`"and",`||`"or",`!`"not")

## Functions

The command *fucntion* is used for calling series of commands by typing the name of the function, which makes the whole *JS* page more readable and easier to apply edits to.

**function syntax:**

Setting *function* can be done as follows:

```
function "the name of the function" ("argument"){

  "series of commands"*;
}
```

Calling *function* can be done as follows:

 `"the name of the function"("argument);`
