### Mindset:
*Mindset*: mindset is basically is the state of your mind, and how deal with things against your well.

*There are two types of mindsets*:

1.Static mindset:
  - It's basically being a negative person who gets disappointed if someting heppens against his/her well.
  
2.Growth mindset (the desirable one):
  - unlike the first one, being a positive person who finds a route that guides him/her to the solution to his/her problems, and becomes a better and stronger person than he/she was before.

For me personally, i keep my growth mindset up by:

-Reminding myself that the hard times will pass and nothing stays the same.
-Reminding myself that after these times pass i will be better at dealing with the upcoming difficulties.
-Staying around the people with growth mindset and leaving the negative and toxic people.
