## GitHub

![GitHub](https://portswigger.net/cms/images/54/14/6efb9bc5d143-article-190612-github-body-text.jpg)

It's a tool that developers use for:

1-Code editing managment, by that i mean every one can edit the same code and upload their edits without causing interuption or confusion to each other, this is possible by a feature called "push and pull" where each developer pulls (download) the code and after he edits it he can't push (upload) it back if another developer has edited the code and pushed it back before him until he pulls the newer version and then he can edit it and push it to GitHub.

2-Sharing projects and providing full informations about it.

3-Providing help to other people with their projects.

4-and finally you might be able to get a job by being an effective member in GetHub community because you can provide your contact informations for the other to contact you and wether you are employed or not.


## Markdown language

Previously we talked about providing informations about a certain project ,so how that can be done using GetHub ?

Markdown language is a simple language that developers use to make explaining codes much easier by providing simple ways to outline certain words and sentences, also it provides a way to distinguish the code part and the regular "guiding" text, and of course the ways to write links and lists ....etc

here are some examples:

if we want to write a bold text we use \*\*text**... the result will be **text**

if we want to point out a code we use \`this is code text\`... the result will be `this is code text`
