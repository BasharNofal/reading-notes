There are three layer that web pages consist of:

1-Content layer: it's added by *.html* files, this layer represnts the structure of web pages.

2-Presentation layer: added by *.css* files, this layer adds a wide variety of sylings and coloring to web pages.

3-Behavior layer: added by *.js* files, basically this layer makees web pages interactive and it behaves according to what the user does.


Now, let's talk about how **JavaScript** code can be added to a web page. Similar to how *CSS* code can be added, there are mainly two ways to add **JS** code:

1-Use `<script>"JS code"</script>`

2- `<script>src=".js file name"</script>`
