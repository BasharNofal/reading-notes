## While and For Loops

Loops in general are used when you want certain commands to be executed multiple times until certain condition is achieved.

The difference between **while loops** and **for loops** can be illustrated by showing the syntax for both commnads:

### For Loops Syntax

```
for ("variable"="value 1";"variable" "comparsion operator" "value 2";"counter"){

    "the commands that you want them to be repeated";
}

``` 
The sequence of **for loops** is after "variable" is defined the condition statement will be checked if its resault was true the commands between the curly brackets get executed and then "counter" gets executed, and this goes on until the condition statement's results is false.

### While Loops Syntax

```
while ("condition statement"){

    "the commands that you want them to be repeated";
}

``` 

**While looops** sequence is similar to **for loops** sequence, the commands will be executed after the condition statement is checked and the result is true, and this goes on until the condition statement's results is false.2
